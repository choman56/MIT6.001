# Description:
# I strated going thru the MIT online course (Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python (Course number 6.0001)
# (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)
# in the spring of 2020 to refresh my understanding of basic computer science and learn something about Python programming.
#
# This was done mostly for recreational purposes but there may be some future use for this knowledge. Who knows. 
# I plan to complete this course by middle of July. In September, I will begin the sequel course, 
# 'Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science (Course number 6.0002)
# (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/)
# which is a continuation of 6.0001
# to expand my understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems
